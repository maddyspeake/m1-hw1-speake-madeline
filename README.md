## About Me
My name is Maddy Speake! I'm 27 years old, live in Tallahassee (but will still chomp this football season), and am from Atlanta. I live with my husband Forrest and my pekingese Howie who is a cheese-loving rascal. My favorite things to do are cook, hike, do NYT puzzles, and be around animals.
## Past Coding Experience 
I am just about as fresh as one can be, except for my elementary years using Neopets and copy/pasting/slightly tweaking HTML/CSS codes for my pets' pages. Which is to say, I'm ready to learn!
## Career Goals
I currently work for HR with the state of Florida, but my goal is to do something where I can work more remote and more flexibly, like with coding. Something in Web Design really appeals to my desire to flex my creativity within the bounds of (hopefully) pretty clear-cut frameworks.
